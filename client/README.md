# Project Setup

Welcome to our React project! This README will guide you through the setup process and provide essential information to get you started.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js & npm: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Git: [Download and Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Config .env:**

   ```bash
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start a development server and open the project in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the source code will be automatically reflected in the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

## Folder Structure

The project structure should look something like this:

```
└── client/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── app
    │   ├── assets
    │   ├── components (shared components)
    │   ├── consts
    │   ├── features/
    │   │   ├── components/
    │   │   │   └── featureComponent1.tsx
    │   │   ├── featureapi.ts
    │   │   └── featureSlice.ts
    │   ├── hooks/
    │   │   └── useAuth.ts
    │   ├── pages/
    │   │   └── home.tsx
    │   └── main.tsx
    ├── .env
    └── package.json
```
